## Tools

1. ```Qt6```
1. ```PySide6``` / ```PyQt6```
1. ```pytest```
1. ```pytest-qt```

## The Project
The goal of the project is to explore Test-Driven Development of a GUI - specifically a Python Qt GUI.

To this end, we will use the Stories and Tasks from Part III of Test-Driven Development: A Practical Guide by
David Astels. The code in the book is (old) Java based. This project is an experiment to see if the code can be ported to
Python, Qt and the pytest framework.
